## How to build

The EOSC Recommender Metrics Framework is comprised of three main components.

1. The **Preprocessor** component is tasked with retrieving data from various sources in either batch or real-time mode, storing it in a MongoDB database.
2. The **RS Metrics** component undertakes complex calculations involving statistics, metrics, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
3. The **API/UI** entails a RESTful API coupled with a user-friendly UI dashboard, seamlessly delivering reports as a web service and visually presenting metrics.

Instructions on how to build each one of the services described above can be found in this [EOSC Recommender Metrics Framework README](https://github.com/ARGOeu/eosc-recommender-metrics/blob/master/README.md).
