## How to build

### Mongo DB

The EOSC Recommender Metrics Framework relies on MongoDB as a crucial component for its functionality, benefiting from MongoDB's robust and scalable database solution.
To install MongoDB, visit the MongoDB Download Center at <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community>, choose your operating system, and follow the installation instructions. Once installed, start the MongoDB server and access the MongoDB shell for seamless database interaction.


### EOSC Recommender Metrics Framework

To successfully run the program, having Python3 installed is mandatory. Along with the Python3, make sure to check and install the necessary dependencies outlined in [requirements](https://github.com/ARGOeu/eosc-recommender-metrics/blob/master/requirements.txt).

To further streamline the process and manage the dependencies efficiently, consider utilizing a Python environment manager like Conda. You can install Conda by downloading the installer from the official website e.g. <https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>.

Integrating the UI of the software with [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/install.html) or [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/install.html) enhances web server efficiency, offloading tasks like load balancing and static file management. It also adds a layer of security and scalability, allowing it to focus on application logic.
